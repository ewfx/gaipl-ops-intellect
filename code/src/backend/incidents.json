Logs on the DNS server showed periodic drops in network connectivity correlated with the reported user issues. Secondary DNS server was not properly configured for failover, exacerbating the issue.",
        "resolution": "The faulty network interface card on the primary DNS server was identified and replaced. Network connectivity was restored, and DNS resolution returned to normal.  Additionally, the secondary DNS server was correctly configured for automatic failover in case of primary server failure.  All internal web applications were tested to confirm accessibility.  Users were notified of the resolution and advised to clear their browser cache and DNS cache if they continued to experience issues.",
        "prevention": "Implemented continuous monitoring of the DNS servers' network interfaces and system health.  Configured automated alerts for connectivity drops or performance degradation.  Regularly tested the failover mechanism to ensure redundancy and prevent future outages. Documented the entire incident and resolution process for future reference and training."
